          I was a member of the Northeastern University team competing in the 2022 NASA Big Idea Challenge which focused on creating novel mobility solutions for robotic exploration on the lunar south pole. 
          Our team built COBRA, the Crater Observing Bio-inspired Rolling Articulator. COBRA is an 11-DOF modular snake robot capable of sidewinding and tumbling down crater slopes. 
          I was responsible for designing and constructing the power system, which consists of individual LiPo batteries connected to voltage regulators that power each module. 
          I also assisted in writing the proposal and technical reports and rigorously testing the system. At the Big Idea Forum, we presented our unique rover locomotion in the deserts of Pasadena, California along with 
          6 other university teams. At the conclusion of the conference, we were awarded the Artemis Award for “the concept with the best potential to contribute to and be integrated into an Artemis mission.” 
          Since then, we have received additional funding from other sources to continue developing the current system and to manufacture a second, more space-rated prototype.
