          I worked full-time as a plasma engineer co-op at the energy startup MAAT Energy for 6 months. MAAT Energy focuses on using atmospheric microwave plasma to pyrolyze methane gas into hydrogen and carbon black. 
          This offers a low-cost, environmentally-friendly alternative to conventional hydrogen production methods such as steam reforming and electrolysis. During my time at MAAT, 
          I operated various plasma reactors to perform daily experiments and researched methods to optimize gas conversion. I also used modeling software such as COMSOL to design applicator structures that 
          enhanced radio frequency strength in a specified region. Through my research we developed several novel techniques for microwave plasma ignition that were successfully implemented on a large-scale 6kW system. 
          My time at MAAT concluded with the submission of a detailed SBIR report that I assisted in writing, reporting over 95% methane conversion (up from ~65% when I joined) and around 60% energy efficiency (up from 20-30%).
