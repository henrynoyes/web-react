# Description

This is a progress log for an ongoing project to build a replica R2-D2 astromech droid from Star Wars. The majority of the parts will be 3D printed using CAD files from [astromech.net](https://astromech.net/).

# 2/24/24 â€“ The Beginning

The first part has been delivered. This ring will provide a rotating base for the upper dome.

With the recent addition of the Bambu X1-C printer, the first set of dome parts are printing smoothly (and quickly).

Dome walls are fully printed. Time to sand.
